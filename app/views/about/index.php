            Batik is a very valuable national cultural heritage of Indonesia.
            The history of batik in Indonesia can be traced to the period of the
            Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms in the 7th to 14th centuries, and has
            continued to develop until now. After Indonesian independence in
            1945, batik was recognized as an important part of Indonesia
            national cultural heritage and became increasingly popular
            worldwide.
